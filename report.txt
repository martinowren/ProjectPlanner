1. What is the time complexity of your solution? You must explain the stated complexity. If you have different complexity for each problem, you need to discuss them seperately.

Firstly I am going to list up all the used functions and their Big Oh notation:
- isRealizable() = O(|N|)
The function runs N (The amount of vertices) times before it hit's it's base case.

- tilbakeStilling() = O(|N|)
The function loops through all of tasks 1 time, so it's only run N times

- TopologicalSort() = O(|N|)
The function runs multiple loops for each task, but O(N) + O(N) = O(N). And therfore the the Big
Oh notation for this solution is O(|N|)



2. What requirements are there for input graph in order for the project to be successfully planned? Please put the discussion in the list of the graf theoretical properties.

Requirements:
All edges have to be directional. If we have a edge that is not directional, we can risk the planner just 
goes back and forth into a cycle. 
There has to be a finite amount of tasks for a project to be planned. 
Have to be a DAG. Directional Acyclic Graph. 




3. What kind of the graph algorithms did you use in your implementation?
I used Topological sorting to queue the tasks correctly. The one I used is heavily influenced by the one found in our algorithm book
